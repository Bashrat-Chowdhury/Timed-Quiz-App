# <Coding Quiz>

This project was focused on building a simple quiz from scratch. Quizes are a very common application used on the internet. It is a fun and quiz way of testing someone's knowledge on any topic in the world!

On top of revisiting HTML, CSS, and Javascript the quiz app also utilzed several Web APIs like the use of attribute setting to change attributes of different elements, time intervals to time the quiz, event listeners to trigger the subsequent step during the quiz, local storage to store the user's quiz score and initials, etc.
